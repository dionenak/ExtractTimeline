# ExtractTimeline

## Description
Create a timeline of events described in a single document ("aretha.txt"). Write a function that extracts date expressions from a text, converts the dates to the ISO 8601 date standard and prints a table with in the left column the standardized dates and in the right column for each date the sentence from which the date was extracted. Then run the script on a second document ("bio.txt") for improving time patterns.
